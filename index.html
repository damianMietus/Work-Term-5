            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p class="lead">My name is Damian Mietus. As of writing this, I am entering my fifth and final year of studies at the University of Guelph where I am enrolled in Computer Science. In addition, I have completed my minor in Business as of the completion of the S20 term. This page will go through my experience during the W20 work terms that took place at Manulife in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. The S20 work term was still with Manulife, but virtually due to current world circumstances. After reading this page, you should have gained some insights into what I learned at Manulife and how they have helped me grow as a developer.</p>

            <h2>Job Description</h2>
            <p class="lead">My role at Manulife was as a 'DevOps Engineer'. This title feels accurate since I had the duties of a software engineer, but worked in the specific area of DevOps related software and services. Having a strong foundation in DevOps from a previous work term, I found my previous experiences exceptionally beneficial in this role. I could not imagine a better way to be introduced to an intensive software engineering role, it was crucial to have my strong foundation in DevOps to be able to adapt quickly to the sprints. Even though my team was meant for DevOps continuous integration and development, we were still strictly a software development team.<br><br>
              During my W20 term at Manulife, my role primarily consisted of me working in two specific areas. The one where the bulk of my contributions applied to was working with existing Jenkins pipeline code with Groovy-lang. The other focus for my sprint tasks were involved with another tool my team supported, and it was to develop updates to a tool that could automate some DevOps activities. This tool was built leveraging the stack of React, Node and MongoDB which was a fantastic experience as it was my first time working in a full stack environment in a professional setting. Both of these areas had some overlap with the overall expectations and requirements with what was delivered. This was made sure with how we were expected to take a sprint task from start to finish. This included having to gather requirements from stakeholders and draft documentation yourself. This meant that I was also responsible for participating in a few public sprint demos where I was able to explain my updates to a wide audience of end users. <br><br>
              Continuing into my S20 term, I found that the permanent shift to work from home was not too difficult. I could have the occasional day of losing focus, but the overall experience was pretty smooth when my internet connection was able to cooperate. My focus was still on pipeline related updates with Groovy-Lang but the topics got more advanced as my experienced continued to grow with it. The new second area I got to dig into was with Docker related tasks. Being another technology I have never worked with, it took some getting used to for me to understand Docker. After a few sprints, I was able to find some success with utilizing Docker and am very thankful for this opportunity to try new technologies that were new to me. On the subject of getting exposed to new subjects, one opportunity I had was to participate as a member of a Co-op Hiring Comittee. I had gained valuable experience in the recruiting process of seeing how a resume reaches the managers and what is being sought out during the interview process.</p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              I had three learning goals to accomplish for my eight months at Manulife. These remained the same for both my winter and summer placements. The first of these was for me to gain exposure to working on a full stack project. I found that I had achieved success with this goal as I was able to work on a DevOps tools that was built using a full stack. Being able to integrate multiple layers of a software project into one is a very rewarding feeling, especially considering my lack of knowledge with specific tools, such as React. Even though this area was something I worked with for only a handful of sprints, I found that I was able to quickly adapt and understand the technologies involved with the full stack that was used here.<br><br>
              The second learning goal I had set out was to gain an understanding of Docker. I feel that despite my work with Docker being brief, it felt effective for my learning of this new tool. I had gone through some introductory courses on Docker which made being thrown into some Docker heavy sprints a bit easier. I found the first sprint where my focus was on Docker tasks was pretty slow, it took me some time to understand the tool and all the potential pitfalls of compatibility issues your virtualized software can run into. After that first hurdle, the following sprints were far easier having learned what I did from the previous ones.<br><br>
              The final learning goal I had set out to accomplish was to become more autonomous and be able to complete sprint tasks independently. With the beginning of my work term, I was constantly met with tasks introducing me to foreign concepts and I would request help from my team to understand these issues. As my work term progressed, I found that I would either see similar issues pop up or just try to use previous experiences to try and solve the issue independently. I feel like I had neither success or failure on this learning goal. There would be some issues I could persevere on my own, whereas other issues if I had not asked for help I was simply wasting time from my lack of knowledge on the task. What this boiled down to was a balancing act of knowing when to ask for help or when to know I was confident enough to solve the issue alone. By the end of the work term, I found more success with this than I did at the beginning or the middle of my term.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="lead">
                With this being my final work term, I am happy with my performance at Manulife. I thought I understood version control from my previous work term, but my time at Manulife has solidified it into something I must know in my day to day as a software engineer. It did not really matter what technologies I was presented with, because I could always just force myself to learn them and adapt for what was required. I found the responsibilities of this role to be far more demanding than my previous work terms, but that only made it more fun.<br><br>
                In summary. I found my time at Manulife to be very eye opening. The role of software engineering is far more demanding than my previous roles, which made it the most learning I have had on any work term by far. It has also left me confused on what I want to do after I complete my undergraduate. I do enjoy the work here, but I feel that I need to explore some final year electives at Guelph in other areas of computing such as data science or machine learning. I want to see some other areas before I fully commit myself to a career path of DevOps.
